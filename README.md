# Ames_House_practice
This is the first repository in Github.

For this Ames House project practice, I have two data sets which are train dataset and test dataset. 
I used regression model to predict House Sale Price and classification model to predict Sale Condition.

I cound not install the XGBoost that should be the best model for this dataset on my computer, which made me feel regret.
